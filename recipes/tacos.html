    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>
        A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef,
        pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese,
        allowing for great versatility and variety.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole,
        or sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 an iceberg lettuce(refrigerated)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp sour cream</li>
        <li>2 jalapenos</li>
        <li>2 green chillies</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>1/3 red, yellow and green bellpepper</li>
        <li>100 gm cottage cheese</li>
        <li>150 gm rajma</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chilly powder</li>
        <li>taco shells</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>cut all the vegetables after having washed them.
            You could cut them any way appropriate for the specific type of vegetable.</li>
        <li>You will now need to prepare the taco shells.
            This step is not very important and can be ignored. The best way of preparing the shells is to lay them
            apart from each other on a sheet pan and heating them up in an oven or a microwave.
            I recommend to heat them for a duration of about 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now lay the vegetables in the taco shell and add sauces over this</li>

    </ol>
